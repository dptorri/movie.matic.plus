                <p>The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American biographical black comedy crime film directed by Martin Scorsese
                    and written by Terence Winter, based on the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort. It recounts Belfort's
                    perspective on his career as a stockbroker in New York City and how his firm Stratton Oakmont engaged
                    in rampant corruption and fraud on Wall Street that ultimately led to his downfall. Leonardo DiCaprio
                    (who was also a producer) stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend Donnie
                    Azoff, Margot Robbie as his wife Naomi Lapaglia and Kyle Chandler as Patrick Denham, the FBI agent who
                    tries to bring him down. Matthew McConaughey, Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, Joanna Lumley and Jean Dujardin
                    also star. The film marks the director's fifth collaboration with DiCaprio, after Gangs of New York (2002),
                    The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010), as well as his second collaboration
                    with Winter after the television series Boardwalk Empire (2010â€“14).</p>
